# README

This is a playground app to study Rails and show that I actually have used the framework.

The app on this repository is the app built in the book Agile Web Development with Rails 7, with a few improvements and differences.

## Improvements & differences from the book

1. Dev container for VS Code configuration files;
1. Docker container for Rails app;
1. Docker container for Selenium and Chrome for system testing.
