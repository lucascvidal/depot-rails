# Depot

This is a playground app built to study Rails. It is based on the depot application from the book "Agile Web Development With Rails 6".

This repository has VS Code dev container files so that you can pick up development fairly quickly without having to spend a lot of time setting up your machine. If you are not using VS Code nor Docker for development, I still suggest taking a look at the .devcontainer directory contents to gather information about the system dependencies, Ruby version and so on.

# Improvements over book's specifications

- Azurite for blob storage;
- SQLite3 replaced for PostgreSQL.
